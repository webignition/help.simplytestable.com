<div class="section"><h2>Most Likely Cause and Fix</h2>
    
    
    
    
    
        
    
    
    
    <div data-generic="true">
        <p>
            In the context of <code>&lt;meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8" /&gt;</code>
            the attribute <code>content</code> is not allowed to take the value <code>text/html; charset=utf-8</code>.
        </p>  
        <p>
            You should remove this attribute or set a valid value for your markup to be considered valid.

    <div data-generic="true">
        <p>
            Some element attributes can take pretty much any value, others
            can take only values of a certain type and others still can only
            take a value from a pre-defined set.
        </p>
        <p>
            This error relates to the following usage in your markup:
        </p>    
        <pre>&lt;meta content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;</pre>
        <p>
            The error is stating that, in this context, the attribute <code>content</code>
            on element <code>meta</code> is not allowed to take the value <code>text/html; charset=utf-8</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The validator is giving the reason: <em>utf-8 is not a valid character encoding name.</em>
        </p>
    </div></div>
<div class="section"><h2>How To Fix It</h2>
    
     
    
     
    
    
    
      
    
    <div data-generic="true">
        <p>
            The error relates to an invalid attribute value being used on a specific
            element.
        </p>    
        <p>
            How this might be fixed often depends on the element, attribute, attribute
            value and the context in which these are being used.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pay attention to the additional information supplied by the HTML
            validator as this will often point you in the right direction: <em>utf-8 is not a valid character encoding name.</em>
        </p>
    </div>

    
    <div data-generic="true">
        <h3>In general</h3>
        <p>
            Change the relevant attribute value to one that is valid for the context
            in which it is being used.
        </p>
    </div></div>
