<div class="section"><h2>Most Likely Cause and Fix</h2>
    <p>
        Your markup makes use of the non-existent attribute <code>x-webkit-speech</code>.
    </p>    
        <p>
            You should remove this attribute for your markup to be valid or consider
            using <a href="http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/">HTML5 custom data attributes</a>.
        </p></div>
<div class="section"><h2>What This Error Means</h2>
    <p>
        There is a defined set of attributes for each HTML element. You may
        choose to omit some but you cannot choose to add further attributes
        beyond those defined.
    </p>
    <p>
        This error is simply saying that the attribute <code>x-webkit-speech</code>
        is not defined for use on any element. It does not exist.
    </p></div>
<div class="section"><h2>How To Fix It</h2>
    <h3>Check your doctype</h3>
    <p>
        Make sure you're using the version of HTML you intended to use.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are transitioning from an older to a newer version of HTML, check
        that the attributes you are using are still valid.
    </p>    
    <p>
        The use of some  attributes may become deprecated over time if they're found to not
        be as useful as intended. Some attributes may be removed entirely.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Type_Declaration">document type declaration</a>
        used in your markup. Fix this if not correct. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are using <a href="http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/">HTML5 custom data attributes</a>
        of the form <code>data-*</code>, make sure you are using the 
        HTML5 doctype: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;,</code>.
    </p> 
    <h3>Simply remove the attribute</h3>  
    <p>
        You have used the attribute <code>x-webkit-speech</code> on an element where the
        element does not allow an attibute of that name.
    </p>    
    <p>
        The specific error message you encountered will refer to a line and column number.
        This will guide you to the exact point in your markup to which the error relates.
    </p>       
    <p>
        You should remove this attribute for your markup to be valid.
    </p>
    <h3>Use a HTML5 custom data attribute</h3>
    <p>
        Are you making up attributes merely as a means of storing data?
    </p>
    <p>
        Whilst the following is invalid HTML, the invalid attributes could
        still end up in the DOM and be accessible via JavaScript:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;img src="http://example.com/image.png" alt="Desc" x-webkit-speech="jon" /&gt;</pre>   
    <p>
        <a href="http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/">HTML5 custom data attributes</a>
        are intended exactly for this purpose. Give it a go if relevant to you.
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;img src="http://example.com/image.png" alt="Desc" data-x-webkit-speech="jon" /&gt;</pre></div>
