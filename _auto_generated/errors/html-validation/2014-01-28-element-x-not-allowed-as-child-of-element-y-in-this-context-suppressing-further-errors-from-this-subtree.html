    <p>
       Your markup includes a
        <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> element inside a <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> 
        and that this is not allowed.
        Re-organise your markup so that this is not the case.       
    </p>    
    <p>
        You may have an unclosed <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> element further up
        the page that is confusing the validator. Check this also.

<div class="section"><h2>What This Error Means</h2>
    <p>
        HTML is often comprised of elements nested inside other elements, such as
        the placing of an anchor within a paragraph:
    </p>    
    <pre>&lt;p&gt;
    Hello &lt;a href="http://example.com"&gt;World!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        There are rules regarding <em>which</em> elements can be nested inside other elements
        and <em>when</em> this is allowed to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most notably, block-level elements, such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
        are not allowed inside inline elements such as <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This error is telling you that your markup includes a
        <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> element inside a <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code> 
        and that this is not allowed.
    </p></div>
<div class="section"><h2>How To Fix It</h2>
    
    <h3>If the error makes immediate sense</h3>
    <p>
        If you look at the line and column number given in the specific error
        you encountered and you can see that you clearly have 
        a <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> element inside a <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code>,
        you need to re-organise your markup so that this is not the case.
    </p>    
    <p>
        This can be a non-trivial task but here is some general advice:
    </p>   
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                don't use block-level elements inside inline elements
            </p>
        </li>        
        <li>
            <p>
                some elements can contain only a small set of child elements,
                such as lists (<code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>)
                allowing only list items (<code>&lt;li&gt;</code>) as direct
                children                
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>If the error does not make immediate sense</h3>
    <p>
        Check again. And then check again one more time.
    </p>
    <p>
        The HTML validator can get confused. There's
        only so much sense it can try to derive from invalid markup.
    </p>
    <p>
       If there really is not a
       <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> element inside a <code>&lt;Y&gt;</code>
       in your markup at the point indicated by the line and column number in the
       specific message you encountered, you will probably find that
       there is an unclosed <code>&lt;X&gt;</code> element further up
       the page that is causing confusion.
    </p></div>
