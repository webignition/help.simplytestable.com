    <h2>Most Likely Cause and Fix</h2>
    <p>
        Your markup contains an ampersand character
        which does not immediately precede anything representing a known entity.
    </p>    
    <p>
        To display a literal ampersand, use
    </p>
    <pre>Poppet &ampamp; Diva are happy fluffy cats</pre> 
    <p>
        instead of
    </p>
    <pre>Poppet &amp; Diva are happy fluffy cats</pre> 
</div>

    <h2>What This Means</h2>
    <p>
        The ampersand (&amp;) has a special meaning in HTML.
        Using a <code>&amp;</code> in your markup does not mean 'display
        an ampersand character, please'.
    </p>
    <p>
        An ampersand is used to start an <em>entity</em>.
        Examples include <code>&amp;amp;</code> to display an ampersand (&amp;)
        and <code>&amp;copy;</code> to display a copyright symbol (&copy;), not
        commonly found on keyboards.
    </p>
    <p>
        This error is telling you that your markup contains an ampersand character
        which does not immediately precede anything representing a known entity.
