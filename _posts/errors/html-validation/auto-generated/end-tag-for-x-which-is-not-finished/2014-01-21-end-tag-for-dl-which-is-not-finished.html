<div class="section"><h2>Most Likely Cause and Fix</h2>

     

    
    
        
    
    
    
    
    
    <div data-parameter-specific="true" data-parameter-keys="%0" data-parameter-values="dl">       
        <p>
            Your markup contains a description or definition list that contains no definitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use:
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Foo&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Bar&lt;/dd&gt;
…
&lt;/dl&gt;</pre> 
        <p>
            instead of:
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</pre>              
        <p>

<div class="section"><h2>What This Error Means</h2>
    <p>
        This error is telling you that the validator reached the end of a 
        <code>&lt;dl&gt;</code> element and found that this element
        did not contain what is expected.
    </p>    
    <p>
        This can happen if you inadvertently include an empty element which should
        contain child elements or if the markup within the element is not valid.
    </p></div>
<div class="section"><h2>How To Fix It</h2>

    
    
         

     
    
     
    
     
    
    <div data-parameter-specific="true" data-parameter-keys="%0" data-parameter-values="dl">       
        <h3>For description or definition lists</h3>
        <p>
            Ensure that all description or definition lists contain definitions. A list containing no
            definitions is not a valid list.
        </p>        
        <p>
            Use:
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Foo&lt;/dt&gt;
  &lt;dd&gt;Bar&lt;/dd&gt;
…
&lt;/dl&gt;</pre> 
        <p>
            instead of:
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</pre>              
        <p>
            Or remove the list entirely.
        </p>
    </div>    

    <h3>In general</h3>   
    <p>
        There is no straightforward common fix for this type of error as it depends
        on the element that raised the error and the context in which this element
        appears in your markup.
    </p>

    <p>
        Refer to the line and column number in the specific error you 
        encountered to get some context on the cause of this error.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Check that you haven't included an element and omitted required child 
        elements, such as including a list that lacks list items.
    </p>   
    
    <p>
        Check that the markup within the relevant element is valid. You may find
        that the relevant element contains additional elements that are not
        correctly nested or are not included within required containing elements.
    </p></div>
