        <p>
            You have neglected to close a previous parent or sibling element,
            resulting in an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element being
            placed where it is not allowed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Check that preceding siblings and parents are correctly closed.

            <strong>Or:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You have JavaScript in a <code>script</code> element that contains
            the string <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> which has not been marked
            as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDATA">character data (CDATA)</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Markup-like strings within JavaScript that is not marked as CDATA
            may be interpretted not as JavaScript but as markup. You do not want this.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Use
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
var string = "&lt;html&gt;";
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</pre> 
        <p>
            instead of

<div class="section"><h2>What This Error Means</h2>
    <p>
        HTML is often comprised of elements nested inside other elements, such as
        the placing of an anchor within a paragraph:
    </p>    
    <pre>&lt;p&gt;
    Hello &lt;a href="http://example.com"&gt;World!&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        There are rules regarding <em>which</em> elements can be nested inside other elements
        and <em>when</em> this is allowed to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most notably, block-level elements, such as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>,
        are not allowed inside inline elements such as <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        This error relates to the <em>when</em> and is telling you that the
        <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element on the relevant line number
        is not allowed at that point.
    </p></div>

    <h3>For strings in JavaScript</h3>
    <p>
        If the line and column number in the specific error message you encountered
        points to a section of JavaScript, you have a character data problem.
    </p>
        <p>
            Markup-like strings within JavaScript that is not marked as CDATA
            may be interpretted not as JavaScript but as markup. You do not want this.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Use
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
var string = "&lt;html&gt;";
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;</pre> 
        <p>
            instead of
        </p>
        <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
var string = "&lt;html&gt;";
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>       
        
     
    <h3>In general</h3>    
    <p>
        The specific error message you encountered will refer to a line and column number.
        This will guide you to the exact point in your markup to which the error relates.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Find the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element in question and check to see what
        element it is inside of.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check that you haven't failed to close a preceding sibling.
    </p>
    <p>
        Check that the relevant <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> is actually used in
        a place that it is allowed to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        Many elements have restrictions on the types of elements allowed inside them.
        For example, a list element can only have children that are list item elements.
