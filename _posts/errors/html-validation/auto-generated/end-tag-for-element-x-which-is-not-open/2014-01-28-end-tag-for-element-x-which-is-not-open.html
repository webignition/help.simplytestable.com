<div class="section"><h2>Most Likely Cause and Fix</h2>
    
        
    
    <div data-generic="true">
        <p>
            Your markup contains a closing tag in the form of <code>&lt;X /&gt;</code>
            that is lacking a preceding opening tag such as <code>&lt;X â€¦ &gt;</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Either:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The relevant element was inadvertently closed too soon when another element was
            intended to be closed:
        </p>

        <pre>&lt;X&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
    Foo
  &lt;/X&gt; &lt;!-- X is closed where when span should have been closed --&gt;
&lt;/X&gt; &lt;!-- This will cause an error when the X is closed again --&gt;
        </pre>   
        <p>
            <strong>Or:</strong>
        </p>    
        <p>
            The closing tag <code>&lt;X /&gt;</code> has inadvertently been included twice:
        </p> 
        <pre>&lt;X&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/X&gt;
&lt;/X&gt; &amp;lt!-- closing X tag included twice by mistake --&gt;</pre>        
    </div></div>
<div class="section"><h2>What This Error Means</h2>
    <p>
        Elements in HTML have a start and an end, with sometimes something in the middle:
    </p>    
    <pre>&lt;p&gt; &lt;!-- start --&gt;
  Foo  &lt;!-- middle --&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- end --&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        When you include an element in your markup you should, as you might expect,
        begin with the start, include any content in the middle where relevant
        and finish with the end.
    </p>
    <p>
        To have the closing tag for an element that does not have a start tag is
        to produce invalid HTML and that is exactly what this error is telling you.
    </p></div>
<div class="section"><h2>How To Fix It</h2>
    <p>
        There is no general fix for this type of problem as how to solve it depends
        on the context in which the error occurs.
    </p>    
    <p>
        Use the line and column number in the specific error message you encountered
        to find the position in your markup that is causing the error.
    </p>   
    <p>
        Take a look at the elements in your markup that come before the line
        that is causing the error to give context.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are some common causes for this type of error, although which, if any,
        applies to you depends on the context in which the error occurs.
    </p>
    <h3>The relevant element was inadvertently closed too soon</h3>
    <p>
        The element to which the error relates contains one or more other elements
        and was intended to be as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
    Foo
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
    <p>
        When intending to close the contained <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element,
        you closed the parent element by mistake, producing invalid markup:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;
    Foo
  &lt;/div&gt; &lt!-- div closed by mistake when intended to close span --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; &lt!-- this div close tag now has no matching open tag which causes the error --&gt;
    </pre>
    <h3>Closing tag included twice by mistake</h3>
    <p>
        Your markup contains a straightforward element similar to:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;span&gt;
  Foo
&lt;/span&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
        When closing this element, the closing tag was added twice instead
        of just once, resulting in invalid markup:
    </p>
    <pre>&lt;span&gt;
  Foo
&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt; &lt!-- close tag included twice by mistake --&gt;</pre></div>
