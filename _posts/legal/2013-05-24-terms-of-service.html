    <h3>Service Description</h3>
    <p>
        The service is a web application that lets you submit a web site or web page for
        quality tests, collects errors, warnings or recommendations based on
        the tests performed and presents you with relevant reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        URLs to test are retrieved from the submitted web site's sitemap
        or news feed.
    </p>    
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Use of Public Data</h3>
    <p>
        Sitemap and news feed data, as well as the content of the URLs tested, are
        retrieved by the service on your behalf from your publicly-accessible web site
        and as such are considered public data.
    </p>
    <p>
        You allow the developer to present such public data on the website as is
        required for the results of the performed tests to be meaningful.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Accessing Public Data on Web Sites</h3>
    <p>
        You agree that the service is acting on your behalf as an intermediary
        between yourself and the testing tools provided by the service.
    </p>    
    <p>
        In initiating a web site or web page test as provided by the service
        you take responsibility for the actions of the service in accessing
        the required public data.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Your Account and Data</h3>
    <p>
        In creating an account with the service you are responsible for maintaining
        the security of your account and data.
        You are fully and solely responsible for all activities that occur under and
        in relation to and in connection with your account.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h3>Fees and Payment</h3>
    <p>
        Optional premium paid services are provided by the service. By selecting a 
        premium service you agree to pay Simply Testable the monthly or annual subscription 
        fees indicated for that service.
    </p>   
    <p>
        Payments will be charged on the day you sign 
        up for a premium service, or after a fixed free trial period where applicable, 
        and will cover the use of that service for a monthly 
        or annual period as indicated. Premium service fees are not refundable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Failure to meet a required monthly or annual payment will result in your
        account being downgraded to a free service losing you access to any
        premium features.
    </p>
    <p>
        Financial transactions are handled by our payment provider, <a href="https://stripe/.com/">Stripe</a>.
        You should read the <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/privacy">Stripe privacy policy</a> before
        upgrading to a paid service to understand how your financial data is
        stored and handled.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Stripe will provide some or all of its services  from systems located 
        outside of Europe. Personally identifiable information held by Stripe may 
        be transferred, processed and stored outside of Europe.
