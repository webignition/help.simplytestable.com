    <h2>Service Description</h2>
    <p>
        The service is a web application that lets you submit a web site or web page for
        quality tests.
    </p>

    <p>
        The service performs selected tests against the content of one or more web pages, collects
        errors, warnings and recommendations and presents you with relevant reports.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Public Data</h2>

    <h3>Definition</h3>

    <p>
        Public data is that made available through the Internet in a manner
        that makes such data available to any entity without the need to provide
        any means of authentication or identification.
    </p>

    <p>
        Data made available through a publicly-accessible web site in cases
        where the web site imposes no authentication or identification requirement
        is considered public.
    </p>

    <h3>Ownership</h3>

    <p>
        Ownership of public data remains with the author of the data. Through defining
        such data as public we do not imply that such data is in the public domain.
    </p>

    <h3>Use by the Service</h3>

    <p>
        The service may access all public data as necessary to carry out the tests requested.
    </p>

    <p>
        You allow the developer to present such public data on the website as is
        required for the results of the performed tests to be meaningful.
    </p>

    <h3>Permission to Access</h3>

    <p>
        No permission is required for the service to access public data.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Private Data</h2>

    <h3>Definition</h3>

    <p>
        Private data is that made available through the Internet in a manner that makes such data available
        only to authorised entities on provision of accepted authentication or identification.
    </p>

    <h3>Use by the Service</h3>

    <p>
        The service may access all private data as necessary to carry out the tests requested.
    </p>

    <p>
        You allow the developer to present such private data on the website as is
        required for the results of the performed tests to be meaningful and in a manner
        that reasonably prevents public access.
    </p>

    <h3>Permission to Access</h3>

    <p>
        You may opt to use features allowing the <a href="http://blog.simplytestable.com/testing-password-protected-sites/">testing of password-protected
        sites</a> or the <a href="http://blog.simplytestable.com/custom-cookie-support/">testing of user-specific content</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through the provision of authentication credentials, either directly
        or through the provision of user-identifying cookies, you agree to allow the service
        to access, or attempt to access, all resources available to the specified user.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Responsibility When Accessing Data</h2>

    <p>
        You agree that the service is acting on your behalf as an intermediary
        between yourself and the testing tools provided by the service.
    </p>

    <p>
        In initiating a web site or web page test as provided by the service
        you take responsibility for the actions of the service in accessing
        the required public or private data.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Test Ownership</h2>

    <h3>Definition</h3>

    <p>
        A test initiated by a user is solely the property of the user account
        under which the initiation occurs.
    </p>

    <h3>Public Tests</h3>

    <p>
        A public test is that carried out by a user not signed in to the service.
        Ownership of public tests lie with the developer.
    </p>

    <h3>Private Tests</h3>

    <p>
        A private test is that carried out by a user signed in to the service.
        Ownership of private tests lie with the account holder.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Test Data Retrieval</h2>

    <p>
        To enable normal operation in the testing of a web site, the service may attempt to retrieve
        the web site's:

        </li>
        <li>
            <p><code>sitemap.txt</code></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>sitemap as defined in <code>robots.txt</code> and/or any discovered sitemaps</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>sitemaps as defined within discovered sitemaps</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>web page content</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>linked resources as defined in the markup of a web page</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Test Data Storage</h2>

    <p>
        When a single web page test is carried out, the service stores
        the fully-resolved URL of the page tested and the results of the selected tests for that URL.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a full web site test is carried out, the service stores a list of URLs tested
        and the results of the selected tests for each URL.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Test Data Ownership and Access</h2>

    <p>
        Test data is solely the property of the test owner.
    </p>

    <p>
        Results of public tests as presented through the website of the service can be accessed by anyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Results of private tests as presented through the website of the service can be accessed solely by the test owner.
    </p>

    <p>

        Such access is limited to activities necessary to ensuring the continued operation
        of the service such as the investigation of faults or the examination of performance matters.
    </p>

    <p>
