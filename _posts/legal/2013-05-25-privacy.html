        How We Protect Your Personal Information
    </h3>
    
    <p>
        You are asked to choose a password when signing up. This password protects
        your account from being accessed by others.        
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You are responsible for ensuring that the password you choose is neither
        easy to guess nor a noticeably poor choice by anyone reasonably familiar
        with the subject or computer security.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Your account information is stored in our system database. 
    </p>    
    
    <p>
        The information in the system database can be accessed only by those with the system
        database password or by anyone with physical access to our production systems.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        We cannot protect or secure your personal information whilst it is in transit
        to us. It is possible for someone, such as a malicious person or a Goverment
        entity, to intercept information as it is travelling over the Internet. We
        cannot stop this.
